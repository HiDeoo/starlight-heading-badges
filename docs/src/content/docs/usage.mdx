The Starlight Heading Badges plugin provides a custom Markdown syntax to add badges to your headings in Markdown and MDX files.

## Add a badge

Badges are indicated using the colon `:` character followed by the `badge` keyword and the badge content in square brackets `[]`.
By default, the badge will use the theme accent color of your site.

The following example will render a "New" badge using the default theme accent color:

import { Preview } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import Example from '../../components/Example.astro'

<Preview>

```mdx
---
// src/content/docs/example.md
title: My docs
---

### Example :badge[New]

Welcome to my project!
```

<Example slot="preview">

### Example :badge[New]

Welcome to my project!

</Example>

</Preview>

## Customize the badge

Heading badges support built-in badge variants to customize the appearance of the badge.

To specify a variant, add the variant name after the badge content in curly braces `{}` with the `variant` keyword and the variant name.
The accepted variants are available: `note` (blue), `tip` (purple), `danger` (red), `caution` (orange), or `success` (green).

The following example will render a "POST" badge with a green background:

<Preview>

```mdx
---
// src/content/docs/example.md
title: My docs
---

### Example :badge[POST]{variant=success}

Welcome to my project!
```

<Example slot="preview">

### Example :badge[POST]{variant=success}

Welcome to my project!

</Example>

</Preview>

## Add multiple badges

Multiple badges can be added to the same heading by using the [default syntax](#add-a-badge) multiple times and separating badges with a space.

The following example will render a “POST” badge with a green background followed by a "New" badge using the default theme accent color:

<Preview>

```mdx
---
// src/content/docs/example.md
title: My docs
---

### Example :badge[POST]{variant=success} :badge[New]

Welcome to my project!
```

<Example slot="preview">

### Example :badge[POST]{variant=success} :badge[New]

Welcome to my project!

</Example>

</Preview>
