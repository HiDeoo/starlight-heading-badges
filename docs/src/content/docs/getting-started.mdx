A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to easily add [badges](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#badges) to your Markdown and MDX headings that are also visible in the table of contents.
Check out the [demo](/demo/) for a preview of the plugin in action.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight Heading Badges is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-heading-badges" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightHeadingBadges from 'starlight-heading-badges'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightHeadingBadges()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Add a badge to a heading in one of your Markdown or MDX files:

   ```mdx
   ---
   // src/content/docs/example.md
   title: My docs
   ---

   ## Hello :badge[New]

   Welcome to my project!
   ```

4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to see the plugin in action.
